    "In conclusion, I found that on average, the men’s volleyball team was 6 feet 0 inches, or 72.25 inches, and the men’s swimming team was 5 feet 10 inches, or 70.74 inches. Correspondingly, the women's volleyball team was 5 feet 7 inches, or 67.25 inches, compared to the woman’s swimming team, which was 5 feet 4 inches, or 64.33 inches. Based on these findings, we can conclude that in general, regardless of sex, varsity volleyball players tend to be taller than varsity swimming team members. "
